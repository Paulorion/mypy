游릴 80         # through the main API to avoid the threadsafety problems of
游릴 81         # modifying sys.stdout/sys.stderr, but that hasn't been done for
游릴 82         # the dmypy client, so we just do the non-threadsafe thing.

游릴 41     ### Running tests
游릴 42     
游릴 43     Running the full test suite can take a while, and usually isn't necessary when
游릴 44     preparing a PR. Once you file a PR, the full test suite will run on GitHub.
游릴 45     You'll then be able to see any test failures, and make any necessary changes to
游릴 46     your PR.
游릴 47     
游릴 48     However, if you wish to do so, you can run the full test suite
游릴 49     like this:

游릴 54     You can also use `tox` to run tests (`tox` handles setting up the test environment for you):
游릴 55     ```
游릴 56     tox -e py
游릴 57     
游릴 58     # Or some specific python version:
游릴 59     tox -e py39
游릴 60     
游릴 61     # Or some specific command:
游릴 62     tox -e lint
```

游릴 65     Some useful commands for running specific tests include:
游릴 66     ```bash
游릴 67     # Use mypy to check mypy's own code
游릴 68     python3 runtests.py self
游릴 69     # or equivalently:
游릴 70     python3 -m mypy --config-file mypy_self_check.ini -p mypy
游릴 71     
游릴 72     # Run a single test from the test suite
游릴 73     pytest -n0 -k 'test_name'
游릴 74     
游릴 75     # Run all test cases in the "test-data/unit/check-dataclasses.test" file
游릴 76     pytest mypy/test/testcheck.py::TypeCheckSuite::check-dataclasses.test
游릴 77     
游릴 78     # Run the linter
游릴 79     flake8
游릴 80     
游릴 81     # Run formatters
游릴 82     black . && isort .

游릴 101    To get help fixing a specific issue, it's often best to comment on the issue
